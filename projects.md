Here is a collection of projects that my students built.


- The [Waste Classifier](http://193.196.37.242:7860/)  uses AI-based waste image classifier built as part of a project work at the University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe by Ilyesse Hettenbach and Gabriel Schurr.

It can classify a given image of waste into one of the three categories of the German waste system: Organic, Restm√ºll or Wertstoff.
You can upload a picture showing some waste, select a desired AI model (EfficientNet-B3, EfficientNet-B4, VGG19, ResNet50 or DinoV2) and can get a online prediction within seconds. 

For their work, they took a pre-trained vision model and fine tuned it on self collected data of waste to adapt it to the German waste classes.
You can find the their code [here](https://github.com/Gabriel9753/Waste-Classification-Project).
