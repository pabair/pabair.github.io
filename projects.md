Here is a collection of projects that my students were working on (usually as part of a project work at the University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe).

## Waste Classifier 
\[[Demo](http://193.196.37.242:7860/)\]
\[[Source Code](https://github.com/Gabriel9753/Waste-Classification-Project)\]


In this project Ilyesse Hettenbach and Gabriel Schurr developed an AI  system that can classify a given image of waste into one of the three categories of the German waste system: "Organic", "Restm√ºll" or "Wertstoff".

A user can upload a picture showing waste, select a desired AI classification model (EfficientNet-B3, EfficientNet-B4, VGG19, ResNet50 or DinoV2) and get a online prediction about the correct waste category within seconds.

For their work, they took pre-trained vision models and fine tuned them on a set of self taken images of waste, which were labeled according to the German waste categories.
