I am currently involved as a mentor and lecturer in the startup programs of the [Cyberlab Karlsruhe](https://www.cyberlab-karlsruhe.de/starthilfe/cyberlab-accelerator) and the [KI Garage](https://www.ki-garage.de/de/).

Additionally, I also work together with individual startups that focus on machine learning and AI products.
