    Hi, my name is Patrick Baier and I am a professor for machine learning at the University of Applied Science Karlsruhe.

	My main interest lies in applying the toosl of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to real-world problems.
  I teach my students the theoretical foundations in these fields in several
	<a href="https://pabair.github.io/courses.html">courses</a>, while we also work on practical <a href="https://pabair.github.io/courses.html">projects</a> to see what it takes to put machine learning into action.

 I am also collaborating and mentoring startups, helping them bringing their AI powered products to the market. In reverse, I bring the challenges and insights from there back to the classroom and discuss them with my students.
You can find an overview of my current activities in this area on the 
<a href="https://pabair.github.io/startups.html">startups</a> page.
