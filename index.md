Hi, my name is Patrick Baier and I am a professor for Machine Learning at the University of Applied Science Karlsruhe.

My main focus lies in teaching the principles of machine learning and AI to my students. The theoretical foundations are taught along several courses 
(for an overview click [here](https://pabair.github.io/courses.html)), while the students also work on practical projects to implement their learnings and see what it takes to put machine learning into action. 

One further interest of my lies in the challenge of converting machine learning concepts into pratical applications.
