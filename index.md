Hi, my name is Patrick Baier and I am a professor for Machine Learning at the University of Applied Science Karlsruhe.

Besides teaching the principles of machine learning to my students (see courses), my main focus lies in the challenge of converting machine learning concepts into useful applications (see startups).

One other purpose of this homepage is to showcase some of my students work in the area and present some of the projects we did in the past (see projects).
