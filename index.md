Hi, my name is Patrick Baier and I am a professor for Machine Learning at the University of Applied Science Karlsruhe.

My main focus lies in teaching the principles of machine learning and AI to my students. The theoretical foundations are taught along several courses 
(for an overview click [here](https://pabair.github.io/courses.html)), while the students also work on practical projects to implement their learnings and see what it takes to put machine learning into action. 

One further interest of me lies in the challenge of converting machine learning concepts into practical applications. I am collaborating and mentoring several AI startups, helping them brining their AI powered products to the market. In reverse, I try to bring the challenges and insights there back to the classroom and discuss them with my studens.
You can find an overview of the startups I am currently working with [here](https://pabair.github.io/startups.html)).
